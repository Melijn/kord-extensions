/**
 * Convenience function allowing you to pass this check context, if the checks provided in the body pass - even if the
 * check context is currently failing.
 *
 * This will only run the given checks if the current check context has failed. It also resets the check context's
 * passing state and failure message before running the given checks.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * check {
 *     someCheck()
 *
 *     or {
 *         someOtherCheck()
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * **Note:** As always, placing multiple checks within an `or { }` block will result in a block where **all** of the
 * given checks must pass.
